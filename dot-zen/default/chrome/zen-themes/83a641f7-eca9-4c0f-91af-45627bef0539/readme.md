# Floating URL bar

Originally implemented inside zen, now it has been moven into it's own theme for users to enjoy!

This theme will make the URL bar float on top of the webview, making it easier to access and read the URL.

* For any issues, with this theme, please go to the [issues page](https://github.com/zen-browser/theme-components/issues)
