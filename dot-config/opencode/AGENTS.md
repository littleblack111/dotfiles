## Rules
### Not
- Do *NOT* add comments unless ABSOLUTELY necessary, no trivial comment or comments for every line.
- Do *NOT* make trivial functions or variables that are not needed or is only used once or code bloat.
- Do *NOT* remove existing comments.
- Do *NOT* hallucinate.
- Do *NOT* add additionally unnecessary stuff.

### Do
- Do stick to the existing code style, conventions, patterns, and structure.
- Do make as little changes as possible.
- Do check for component/functions if you are not sure for a fact that it exists.
- Do check for anything if needed, time is not an issue.
- Do *fully* test the code if the user has provided a way to reliably test it.
- Do use types if possible and is convenient.
- Do change the plan when variable changes.
- Do read the README.* if exist to understand the project.
- Do reflect and revert/remove any code you've changed that is not necessary.
- Do run the formatter such as cargo fmt, or check Makefile etc. after you finished your changes

## Formatting
- Use tab for indentation.
- Follow the Hungarian notation for appropriate language(i.e. C++).

## Think like a programmer, not a writer, not looking for perfection.
